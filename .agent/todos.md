# AUI System Todos

## Current Sprint
1. [x] Analyze existing AUI implementation 
2. [x] Create .agent directory structure
3. [ ] Create fresh example tools (weather, search) as user requested
4. [ ] Verify tests pass
5. [ ] Run lint and typecheck
6. [ ] Commit changes

## Time Estimate
- Example tools: 10 mins
- Testing: 5 mins  
- Linting: 2 mins
- Total: ~17 mins

## Notes
- AUI system already implemented with desired API
- Focus on creating clean examples the user requested
- Ensure no Lantos references exist
- Keep implementation simple and elegant
