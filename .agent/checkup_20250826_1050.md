# General Checkup - 2025-08-26 10:50 UTC

## Status Summary
✅ **Repository is healthy and clean**
- Branch: main
- 88 commits ahead of origin/main (push pending due to auth)
- Working directory: Clean
- All tests passing (143/143)
- Type checking: No errors

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Checked git status - 88 commits ahead
2. ✅ Reviewed .agent metadata files
3. ✅ Pulled latest changes - already up to date
4. ✅ Ran test suite - all 143 tests passing
5. ✅ Checked for uncommitted changes - working directory clean
6. ⚠️ Attempted push - authentication required
7. ✅ Verified type checking - no errors

## Issues Requiring Attention
- **GitHub Authentication**: Need to run `gh auth login` to enable push
- **88 commits pending push**: Once authenticated, run `git push origin main`

## Recommendations
1. Authenticate with GitHub CLI to enable push
2. Consider setting up a GitHub token for automated operations
3. Update the 12 outdated packages when convenient
4. Migrate from deprecated Next.js lint to ESLint CLI
