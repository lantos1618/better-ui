# Lantos AUI Implementation Plan

## Goal
Implement a concise and elegant AUI (Assistant UI) system for AI-controlled frontend/backend operations in Next.js/Vercel.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Tool Builder Pattern**: Fluent interface without `.build()` requirement
2. **Dual Execution**: Server-side and client-side execution paths
3. **React Integration**: Hooks and rendering components
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation

### Key Features
- Ultra-concise API (2 methods minimum: input, execute)
- Optional client-side optimization (caching, offline support)
- React hooks for easy integration
- Server/client execution flexibility
- Built-in rendering support

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core API âœ“
- Already have basic lantos-aui.ts implementation
- Tool class with chainable methods
- AUI global instance

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Current Focus)
- Improve the builder pattern for even more concise usage
- Add shorthand methods (t(), do(), simple(), ai())
- Implement retry logic and caching
- Create batch tool definitions

### Phase 3: React Integration
- Enhance hooks (useAUITool, useAUI)
- Create provider components
- Add SSR support
- Implement streaming responses

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests
- Example implementations
- Performance benchmarks

## Design Principles
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself
- **KISS**: Keep it simple, stupid
- **Practical**: Focus on real-world usage
- **Elegant**: Clean, readable API
