# Development Plan - Better UI Project

## Project Vision
Build a robust AI-powered UI framework (AUI) that seamlessly integrates AI capabilities into React components, providing developers with powerful tools for creating intelligent user interfaces.

## Current Phase: Stabilization & Documentation
1. **Code Quality** âœ…
   - All tests passing (143 tests)
   - TypeScript checks passing
   - ESLint checks passing

2. **Repository Management** ðŸ”„
   - Need to push 49 commits to origin
   - Requires GitHub authentication setup
   - Consider commit history cleanup

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up GitHub CLI authentication
   - Push pending commits
   - Review commit history for potential squashing

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - Enhance documentation for AUI components
   - Create more comprehensive examples
   - Add integration tests for complex scenarios

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Performance optimization
   - Bundle size reduction
   - Advanced tool implementations
   - Community contribution guidelines

## Architecture Principles
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Server and client execution modes
- Extensible tool registry system
- Type-safe implementations throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for tool interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- 80/20 rule: 80% implementation, 20% testing
