# Merge and Maintenance Plan

## Current Status
- On main branch (clean)
- lantos-aui branch exists locally and remotely
- Recent commits show AUI system implementation completed

## Plan
1. Pull latest changes from remote
2. Check if lantos-aui has any changes not in main
3. Merge if needed
4. Run tests and build
5. Push to remote
6. Clean up branches if appropriate

## Notes
- Following DRY & KISS principles
- Maintaining simplicity and elegance
- Using git best practices
