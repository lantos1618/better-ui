# AUI Implementation Plan

## Vision
Create the most concise and elegant API for AI to control Next.js applications, enabling seamless frontend and backend operations through tool calls.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation âœ…
- Builder pattern for fluent API
- Tool registry for management
- Server/client execution split
- Type-safe with Zod schemas

## Phase 2: Enhancement (Current)
1. **Verify Core Functionality**
   - Test builder chain
   - Validate registry operations
   - Check server/client execution

2. **Create Showcase**
   - Simple tools (weather, calc)
   - Complex tools (search, database)
   - AI control examples (theme, layout)
   - Real-world scenarios

3. **Add Testing**
   - Unit tests for builders
   - Integration tests for executors
   - E2E tests for tool calls

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - TypeScript validation
   - Linting compliance
   - Bundle optimization

## Phase 3: Future Enhancements
- Telemetry and monitoring
- Tool composition/chaining
- Advanced caching strategies
- WebSocket support for real-time
- Tool marketplace/registry

## Success Metrics
- API conciseness (< 5 lines for simple tool)
- Type safety (100% inference)
- AI usability (intuitive for LLMs)
- Performance (< 50ms tool execution)
- Developer experience (minimal learning curve)
