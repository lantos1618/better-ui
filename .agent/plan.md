# AUI System Plan

## Goal
Implement a concise and elegant AUI (Assistant-UI) system for tool calls that enables AI to control both frontend and backend in Next.js/Vercel.

## Core Requirements
1. Clean, fluent API without .build() methods
2. Support for both server and client execution
3. React component rendering
4. TypeScript + Zod integration
5. Simple tools need only 2 methods (execute + render)
6. Complex tools can add client optimization

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Core AUI class implemented
- ✅ Fluent interface without .build()
- ✅ Tool creation and execution
- ⏳ Need to verify examples match requested API
