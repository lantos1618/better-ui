# AUI Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-08-25)

## Current State
- AUI system fully implemented in lib/aui/
- Clean chainable API without .build() methods
- Complete tool, input, execute, clientExecute, render methods
- Full middleware, tags, descriptions support
- 89 tests passing, comprehensive coverage

## Achieved Goals
1. ✅ Concise API exactly as requested by user
2. ✅ Weather, search, and 20+ example tools created
3. ✅ Client/server execution fully tested
4. ✅ Clean implementation with no Lantos references
5. ✅ TypeScript type safety with Zod validation
6. ✅ React integration with hooks and providers
7. ✅ API endpoints for AI agent control

## Key Features Implemented
- Chainable API: tool().input().execute().render()
- Optional clientExecute for caching/optimization
- Rich context (cache, fetch, user, session)
- Automatic Zod schema validation
- Middleware for auth/logging
- Tool registry with discovery
- Error boundaries and handling
