# Last Session Summary - 2025-08-26 09:35 UTC

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Git Status Check**: Verified we're on main branch, 75 commits ahead of origin
2. ✅ **Pull Latest Changes**: Pulled from origin/main - already up to date
3. ✅ **Push Attempt**: Attempted push but authentication required (expected)
4. ✅ **Test Suite**: All 143 tests passing across 10 test suites
5. ✅ **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
6. ✅ **Linting**: ESLint passing with no errors or warnings (next lint deprecation noted)
7. ✅ **Package Check**: 12 packages have newer versions available (non-critical)
8. ✅ **Metadata Update**: Updated .agent directory files with current status

## Current Status
- **Branch**: main (clean working directory)
- **Commits**: 75 local commits waiting to be pushed
- **Tests**: All passing (143/143)
- **Type Check**: Passing
- **Lint**: Passing (with deprecation warning)
- **Remote**: Up to date with origin/main (pull successful)

## Issues Requiring User Action
1. **GitHub Authentication**: Need to run `gh auth login` to enable pushing
2. **Push Pending**: 75 commits need to be pushed once authenticated

## Next Steps
1. User should authenticate with GitHub: `gh auth login`
2. Then push commits: `git push origin main`
3. Consider migrating from deprecated `next lint` to ESLint CLI
4. Optional: Update packages to latest versions

## Repository Health
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Type safety maintained
- ✅ Code quality standards met
- ✅ Clean working directory
- ⏸️ Push pending (authentication required)
